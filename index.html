<p> The Son of Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo, 
  <a id="tribute-link" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Caedus" target="_blank"> Jacen Solo</a> was a leading Jedi Knight who proved crucial in defeating the Yuuzhan Vong and protecting the galaxy during the Yuuzhan Vong War. The grandson of Darth Vader, Darth Caedus was a Sith Lord who turned against his family and friends, betraying his former principles and leading the Galactic Alliance he once championed into a reign of terror as he attempted to bring order and stability to a fractured galaxy. It was Solo's desire to protect the galaxy and his increasing willingness to accept any cost in that cause that facilitated his fall to the Sith.</p>

  Born in 9 ABY, Jacen Solo spent most of his early years as the target of various kidnapping plots and schemes against his famous parents. When he was thirteen, he and his twin sister Jaina began attending the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4, where their uncle Luke Skywalker taught them the ways of the Force. There he made several friends, among them the Hapan princess Tenel Ka Djo, to whom he became strongly attracted. While training, he and his friends defeated numerous plots against the New Republic and, in 24 ABY, he and his younger brother Anakin were apprenticed to Skywalker. A philosopher who struggled with the idea of employing violence to fight violence, Solo entered a personal crisis with the outbreak of the Yuuzhan Vong War. He preferred to serve off the front lines, but felt obligated to volunteer for the strike team assembled to eliminate the voxyn queen at Myrkr. There, Anakin Solo was killed and Jacen Solo stepped up to lead the team, killing the queen and ending the voxyn threat before he was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong.

  <p><strong>Early Years</strong><br>
Jacen Solo was a figure of galactic political significance before he was even born. The son of former smuggler, retired general, and Rebel icon Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa Solo of Alderaan, the New Republic Minister of State, Jacen Solo and his twin sister Jaina were immediately matters of public interest, and news of the pregnancy was spread throughout the New Republic. Taking a different sort of interest in the developing twins, Grand Admiral Mitth'raw'nuruodo, the new leader of the Galactic Empire's military, promised Organa Solo's powerful Jedi children to Joruus C'baoth, the insane clone of Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth, as his to raise and make his apprentices in exchange for C'baoth's participation in the Grand Admiral's schemes. This resulted in several kidnapping attempts by Grand Admiral Thrawn's Noghri agents against Organa Solo during her pregnancy. Organa Solo evaded all of them and was able to appeal to the Noghri to change their allegiance to her, exposing Thrawn's manipulations of their people and playing on their reverence for Darth Vader, the man who had been Organa Solo's father.

<p><strong>Last Days</strong><br>
Caedus ordered the Anakin Solo and Megador into battle to support the struggling Imperial fleet and tasked Veila with finding the true location of the Jedi base in the system, as the space station from which they had fled had clearly been a decoy. Not trusting the Moffs to obey him, Caedus went to release the imprisoned Isolder, who would have to be their source for any nanokiller. Isolder, however, was convinced that Caedus was letting him return to the Hapan fleet in order to spread the nanokiller. Knowing he could never convince the man he respected, the grandfather of his child, to escape, Caedus killed him instead.

He took the body to the medical incinerator for safe disposal, where the medical droid examining the corpse pronounced that tissue samples had already been taken; the Moffs had their nanokiller. He contacted his chief aide, Orlopp, who confirmed that a ship almost certainly carrying the nanokiller had just left the Anakin Solo. Caedus was at the door to leave and hunt down the dangerous ship himself when Jaina Solo opened it and attacked, stabbing him in the abdomen. The Sith Lord merely expressed mild surprise before flinging his sister away with the Force and drawing his weapon. The pair battled fiercely before Caedus gained separation from his sister and deactivated his lightsaber. He pleaded with her to cease the fight so he could save Djo and Allana, but Jaina refused to believe her brother. They reengaged, each wounding the other, but Caedus was at a disadvantage as his many unhealed wounds from his previous duel, missing arm, and now disabled foot left him vulnerable. Jaina rushed to attack, slashing at Caedus in such a way that he could not possibly hope to defend himself. Knowing he would die, Caedus had the option of taking his twin down with him, as her strike left her open to fatal counter-attack. However, he declined to do so, believing that the action would serve no purpose other than revenge. Instead, he used his last moments to contact Djo in the Force and warn her that she and Allana were in danger. At that same instant, his twin bond with his sister returned, just before he died. These actions convinced Jaina that, in his final moments, the persona of Darth Caedus had retreated and some of Jacen Solo's light side aspect had shown through. Caedus's death at the hands of his twin sister fulfilled the Yuuzhan Vong's prophecy of the twin sacrifice
